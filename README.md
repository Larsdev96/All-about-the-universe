# All-about-the-universe

Development is still in progress. Dark and lightmode have been added. 
Future steps are adding more details to the planets and finishing the first main planets. After this the next step will be making sure that the search
option is fully working. After this is completely working without any mistakes I will start adding new planets. Unfortunately checking the data for the
planets and working things out in both metric and imperial numbers is very time consuming.
